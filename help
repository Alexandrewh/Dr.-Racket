Let x be a node and L be a list of nodes in ascending order of their values. A node is represented as a pair (name value), i.e., it is itself a list. Then a list of nodes is represented by a list of lists. Write a Lisp program to insert node x into L in such a way that the resultant list remains in ascending order of their nodes' values. After each insertion, list L is enlarged by on node. 
 
Apply your program to the following data. Successively insert the following nodes  
1)	(b 5)     2) (e 20)     3) (f 1)     4) (g 6) into the initial list L = ((a 2)  (b 5)  (c 10));
